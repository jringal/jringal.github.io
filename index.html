		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Joel Darryl Ingal, or JD for short. I am a quality and detail-oriented graduate (Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering) from the University of California, Irvine graduated this recent June 2019. <br><br>Throughout the course of my academic and professional career, I managed to work on various engineering and software development projects and designs across different engineering fields. During my time working on said projects, I learned valuable engineering skills such as product design/planning, technical documentation, and critical thinking. I'm a quick learner, always looking to improve myself and any projects I work on. I’m not afraid to ask questions or ask for help to better myself and benefit those that I work with. I hope to leverage all that I offer and more into any and all projects I work on. </p>
