		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Joel Darryl Ingal, or JD for short. I am a quality and detail-oriented graduate (Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering) from the University of California, 
            Irvine graduated this recent June 2019. My hobbies include taking care of my two dogs, Jelly and Kino, playing guitar and videogames, going to the gym, and coding! My favorite
            coding languages are Java and JavaScript.  I hope to one day be considered a vertern in the software engineering industry and lead my own projects and team of like-minded engineers.
            <br><br>Throughout the course of my academic and professional career, I managed to work on various engineering and software 
            development projects and designs across different engineering fields. During my time working on said projects, I learned valuable engineering skills such as product 
            design/planning, technical documentation, and critical thinking. I'm a quick learner, always looking to improve myself and any projects I work on. I’m not afraid to 
            ask questions or ask for help to better myself and benefit those that I work with. I hope to leverage all that I offer and more into any and all projects I work on. </p>
